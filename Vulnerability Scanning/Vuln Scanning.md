Vuln Scanning

* usually minimally invasive 
* port scan
* identify systems and running software 
* test from inside and outside the network 
* scan types
	* non-intrusive scans
		* gather information, don't try any exploits
	* intrusive scans
		* you'll try out the vulns to see if it works
	* non-cred scans
		* the scanner can't login to the remote device 
	* credentialed scan
		* you're a normal user, emulates an insider attack
* scanner
	* goes through a well defined list of vulns based on what it sees 
	* returns a CVE code to gather more information 
	* you'll have to check manually to see if a system is vulnerable 
* results
	* could show lack of firewall
	* old anti-virus
	* miscongigs 
	* old patches 
* dealing with false postivies 
	* possible to happen, have to manually check each one 
	* false postive - different from a low-severity vuln
		* it's real, but it may not be the highest priority 
	* false postivies also can happen
