		* the big red button 
* safe 
	* secure your inportant hardware and media 
	* protection against the elements 
	* difficult to steal
	* must be carefully managed
		* don't share combo 
* locking cabinents 
	* data center hardware is often managed by different groups 
	* racks can be installed together 
		* side-to-side to protect the side 
	* enclosed cabinents with vents to the front 
		* locked
* protected distribution system (PDS)
	* a physically secured cabled network 
	* protect your cables and fibers 
	* prevent cable and fiber taps 
	* prevent cable and fiber cuts 
		* physical dos attack
	* hardened protected distribution system
		* sealed metal conduit, periodic visual inspection 
* Air gap 
	* physical seperation between devices 
	* most enviroments are shared 
		* air gaps are seperate hardware 
	* specialized networks require air gaps 
		* stock marget 
		* power systems
		* airplanes
		* nuclear power plants 
* mantraps 
	* all doors normally unlocked but 
		* opening one door causes another to lock 
	* all doors normally locked
		* unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked 
	* one door open/other locked
		* when one is open, the other cannot be unlocked
	* one at a time, controlled groups
		* managed control through an area 
* faradat cage 
	* blocks electromagnetic fields 
	* a mesh of conductive material 
		* the cage cancled the electromagnetic fields effect on the interior 
		* microwave oven
	* not a comprehensive solution 
		* not all signals blocked
	* can restrict acess to mobile networks 
		* some very specific contingencies would need to be in place for emergency calls 
* door access controls 
	* concentional lock and key 
	* deadbolt 
	* electronic 
		* keyless
	* token based 
		* magnetic swipe card or prox reader 
	* multi-factor 
		* smart card and a pin 
* biometrics 
	* fingerprint, iris, voiceprint 
	* usually stored a mathematical rep of your bio
		* actual fingerprint isn't usually saves 
	* difficult to change 
	* used in very specific situations 
		* not foolproof 
* barrricades/bollards 
	* prevents access 
	* channel people through a specific access point 
		* allow people, prevent cars and trucks 
	* id safety concerns 
	* can be used to an extrame 
		* moat 
* tokens and cards
	* smart cards 
		* integrated with devices 
		* may require a pin 
	* usb token 
		* cert is on the usb device 
	* hardware or software tokens 
		* generates pseudo-random auth codes 
	* your phone 
		* sms a code to your phone   
* HVAC 
	* data center should be separate from the rest of the building 
		* overheating is a problem
	* closed loop recirculatin and possite preassurization 
		* recycling internal air, and air is pushed out not in 
	* hot and cold aisles 
		* ![e60a5562caf5850d2a3313a40c75099a.png](../../_resources/4ff38cc1029c4159b8022264e229dd29.png)
		* hard or soft wall to seperate 
* fire suppression 
	* electronics require unique responses to fire 
		* no water 
	* detection 
		* smoke, flame, heat 
	* suppress with water when appropriate 
	* suppress with chemicals 
		* halon 
			* destroys the zone 
		* FM-200
			* prevents fire but leaves electronics alone 
* cable locks 
	* temp security 
	* cable works almost anywhere
	* most devices have a standard connector 
		* reinforced notch
	* not designed for long-term protection 
		* cable can be cut 
* screen filters 
	* control your input 
	* also called privacy filters 
* video surveillance 
	* CCTV (Closed circuit television)
	* camera properties are important 
		* focal length - shorter is wider angle
		* depth of field - how much is in focus 
		* illumination requirments - see in dark  
	* often many different camera 
		* network together and record together 
* logs 
	* everything is logged 
	* correlate physical logation with digital access
		* someone logged into the console while in the room
	* need a formal process to collect and archive log info 
		* some of the logs are physical, some digital 
		* may fall under privacy laws 
* key management 
	* physical or digital 
		* protect important access
	* key generation 
		* a formal process to generate access keys 
		* checks and balances 
	* key breaches 
		* unauthorized use 
		* what happens when a key is compromised 
	* create policies with best practices 
		* control your physical security
