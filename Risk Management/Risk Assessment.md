Risk Assessment 

* enviromental threats
	* tornado, hurricane, earthquake, server weather
* man mde threats 
	* internal or external
	* internal threats are from employees 
	* external from outside the org
* quantitative risk calc
	* likelihood
		* annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)
			* how likely is it that in a year you will be hit with a hurricane in montana, in flordia
	* SLE (single loss expectancy)
		* what is the monetyary loss if a single event occurs
		* laptop stole, $1000
	* ALE (annual loss exepectacy)
		* ARO x SLE
		* seven laptops stolen in a year 1000 * 7 = 7000
	* the business impact can be more than monetary 
		* quantitative vs qualitative 
			* quantitative - hardware
			* qualitative - people not working or services not working because someone does not have a laptop
* evaluating risk
	* risk register 
		* every project has a plan, but also risk
		* id and document the risk associated with each step
		* apply possible solutions to the id risk
		* monitor the results 
	* supply chain assessment 
		* get a product or service from supplier to customer 
		* eval corrdination between gorups
		* id areas of improvment

* testing for risk 
	* many servers contain seneitive data 
		* any kind of PII
	* running vuln and pen tests can cause outages 
		* hard to predict how a system will react
	* formal auth is a best practive 
		* remove all legal liability from the testing 
		* vuln scanning is not very invasive
		* pen testing can install backdoors, preform DDoS attacks, transfer sensitive data, and more 
* risk response techniques 
	* risk-avoidance 
		* stop participating in a high-risk activity 
	* transference 
		* buy some insurance 
	* acceptance 
		* a business decision, we'll take the risk
