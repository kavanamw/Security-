Wireless Jamming 

* Raid Frequency jamming
	* Denial of Service at a basic level
	* goal, decrease the signal to noise level at the reciving device, overwhelm it
	* sometimes not intentional
		* microwave, fluoresent lights
* Wireless jamming
	* constant, random bits, legitimate frames
	* data sent at random times - random data and legitimate frames
	* reactive jamming - only when someone else tries to comm
	* needs to be close
	* fox huntin 
		* finding the jamming signal
		* directional antenna, atenuator - makes it quieter so make it easier to find when close
