Vulerability Types 

* Race Condition
	* a lack of taking into account that several uses can use the same resources at the same time
	* when this happens you might have a confusion between who has was since the same thing has been used in different contexts 
	* prevented with proper validation 
* End-Of-Life vulnerabilities 
	* without vendor support, no security patches
	* ex. Microsoft patched a SMB vuln but didnt back patch to XP so WannaCrypt took advantage of that 
	* upgrade to maintain security 
* embedded system vuln
	* no direct access to the system
	* devices are normally connected to the internet 
	* often running old versions of software 
* Lack of vendor support
	* the only ones who can fix the code for IOT and embedded systems 
* Inproper input handling
	* all inputs should be considered malicious 
	* check everything
	* allowing invalid input can be devastating 
	* can take a lot of time to find a valid input 
* inproper error handling
	* error messages shouldn't provide too much detail but should give enough info to solve the error 
* Mis configs/weak configs
	* don't leave any doors or windows open 
	* defaults condigs are very bad
		* the entire mirai botnet is based on defaul creds for IOT devices 
* untrained user 
	* it only takes one person to allow a breach 
	* training is critical for staff 
		* in person an paying attention is important 
		* annual reinforcment is important
* improperly configured accounts 
	* accounds no longer needed 
	* accounts that have admin access that should not have admin access 
* vuln business processes 
	* if theres a way to game the system, the bad guys will find it 
* weak cipher suites 
	* the suit
		* encryption protocol itself
		* the length of the encryption key
		* hash used for the integrity check of data recieved 
	* some suits are easier to crack than others 
	* TLS is one of the most common
	* dont use old hashing algos 
* memory/buffer vuln
	* memory leak
		* unused memory that is not properly released after use
		* begins to slowly grow and either crashes the app or system itself
	* integer overflow
		* large number into a smaller sized space 
		* where does the extra number go 
	* buffer overflow
		* overwriting a buffer of memory 
		* spills into other memory areas 
		* might allow more access than nomal
	* NULL pointer dereferece
		* programming technique that referencs a portion of memory but the referense points to a null
		* app crash, debug info displayed, DoS
	* DLL Injection
		* writing to an external library and manipulate the operating system or application to run the library
* System sprawl/undocumented assets
	* lost old systems that are vuln risks 
	* tracking is a challenge 
	* harder to make things updated 
	* easy to miss  a forgotten computer, may not get updated when it needs to
* Archiecture/design weakness
	* the best security system fails if you don't have lock on the doors
	* examine every part of the network for security risks
* 0 Day attacks
	* what you don't know can really hurt you 
	* vulns sitting around waiting to be found 
* improper cert and key management
	* manage your keys and certs 
		* make sure it is well planned
		* don't do it on the fly
	* what will be the organizations cert authority 
	* how will CA be protected 
	* created and managed
	* validate and sign the cert
