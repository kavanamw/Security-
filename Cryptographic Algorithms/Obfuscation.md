Obfuscation

* Obfuscation
	* the process of making something unclear 
	* not impossible to understand 
	* make source code hard to read 
		* doesn't change the functionality of the code 
	* hide information inside an image 
		* steg
* XOR cipher 
	* outputs true when inputs differ 
	* ![b4fea3df1ac361c8f5c8d57c5d0a2265.png](../../_resources/693d5b20c6d54abdb1f7f5724998616a.png)
	* reverse process to return the plaintext 
	* used extensively in crypto 
		* with a truely random key, the results are theoritically unbreakable 
* subsutition cipher 
	* simple sub 
		* a -> z b -> e .....
	* ROT13
	* caesar cipher 
		* sub one letter with another at a fixed posistion 
		* sub E with B
	* hack these ciphers with frequency analysis or brute force 
		* if you know how it is subed, you can bread it 
* ROT13
	* rotate by 13 letters 
	* comonly found in online forms 
		* obfuscate spoliers
