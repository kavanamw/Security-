Security in the cloud

* on-premise, hosted, and cloud
	* on premise 
		* your apps are on local hardware
		* servers and data in building 
	* hosted
		* your servers are not in your building 
		* may no be your hardware 
		* ususally a specialed computing enviroment 
	* cloud 
		* entiure app instance can be created and torn down on demand
* cloud storage 
	* data is avaialbe anywhere anytime on any device 
		* if you have network you have your data
	* integrated with your enterprise auth
		* use network login to access your data
		* can use 2FA
	* encryption is required 
		* data is not under your direct control
* VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrasturcture)
	* virt the users desktop and run it in the data cetner 
		* sometimes called VDE (Cirtual Desktop Enviroment)
	* all computing power is in the data center 
		* the eend user hardware is a virt desktop
		* small computing requirments 
		* the end user os becomes less important 
	* enhanced security
		* centeralized and easier to manage 
		* changes can be tightly controlled
		* data never leaves data center 
* Cloud access security broker (CASB)
	* clients are at work, data in the cloud 
		* how to keep secure 
	* how do you make your security policies work in the cloud 
		* integrate a CASB
		* impliment local security for the cloud 
	* visibility
		* determine what apps are in use 
		* are they auth to use the app
	* complience 
		* are users complying with HIPPA PCI...
	* threat prevention
		* allow access by auth users, prevent attacks 
	* data security 
		* ensure that all data transfers are encrypted 
		* protect the transfer of PII with DLP
* Security as a service (SECaaS)
	* pay for what you use 
	* scale as needed
	* continuosly monitoring 
		* uniformaly applied to all traffic
	* anti-virus/malware signatures are constantly updates 
		* faster zero day response
