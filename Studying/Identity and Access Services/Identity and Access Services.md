- RADIUS (Remote auth dial-in user service)Â 
    - most common AAA protocols
    - supports a wide variety of platforms and devices
    - not just for dial-in
    - certeralizes auth for users
        - routers, switches, firewalls
        - server auth
        - remote access VPN
        - 802.1X network access
    - RADIUS service available on almost any server os
- TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-control System)
    - remote auth protocol
    - created to control access to dial-up lines to ARPANET
    - XTACACS (Extended TACACS)
        - a cisco created (proprietary) version of TACACS
        - additonal support for accounting and audition
    - TACACS+
        - latest version of TACAS, not backwards campatible
        - more auth requrests and response codes
        - released as an open stardard in 1993
- LDAP (Lightwwieight Direcctory Access Protocol)
    - protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network
    - X.500 sepc was written be the international telecom unioun
    - DAP ran on the OSI protocol stack
        - uses TCP/IP (tcp/389 and udp/389)
    - LDAP is the protocol used to query and update an X.500 directory
        - used in Windows AD, apple opendirectory and opendap
- X.500 distingusied names
    - attribute = value pairs
    - most specific attribute is listed first

- X.500 Directory info tree
    - hierarchial structure
    - container objects, country, org
    - leaf objects
        - users, computers, printers, files

- Microsfot NTLM
    - windows challenge/response
        - domain name, username, password hash
    - LAN manage (LANMAN)
        - microsoft and 3com network os
    - NT LAN mamanger v3 (NTLM) challenge/response
        - hash challenge (simillar to CHAP)
        - somewhat insecure
            - MD5 password hash
            - HMAC-MD5 hash of username and server name
            - variable-l;ength challenge of timestamp, random data, domain name
    - vulns
        - some windows password databases contain LM hash version of the passwords
            - done for compatibility
        - NTLM vuln to a cred forwarding attack
        - migrate to kerberos to fix these
- kerberos
    - network auth protocol
        - auth once, trusted by the system
        - mutual auth
            - the client and the server
            - protects against the main in the middle or replay atacks
    - standard since the 1980s
        - developed at MIT
        - RFC 4120
    - microsoft started using kerberos in windows 2000
        - based on kerberos 5.0 open standard
        - compatible with other os and devices
- SSO with kerberos
    - auth one time
        - lots of backend ticketing
        - crypto tecks
    - no contant username and password input
        - saves time
    - only work with kerberos
        - not everyting is kerberos friendly
