5.2 Cryptographic algos and their basic characteristcs 

* Perfect Forward Security 
	* a means of ensuring that the comparomising of an entity's digital certs or public/private key pairs doesn't compromise the security of any session's key
	* implemented using ephemeral keys for each and every session
	* ensures that if the original asymmetric keys are obtained or disclosed, can't unlock prior sessoins captured by an eavesdropper or man-in-the-middle attack
* Symmetric Algorithms 
	* AES - Advanced Encryption Standard 
		* block cipher 
		* replaced DES 
		* 128 bit block cipher 
		* 128 bit key, 10 rounds of encrpytion 
		* 192 bit key, 12 rounds of encrpytion
		* 256 but key, 14 rounds of encrpytion 
	* DES - Data Encryption Standard
		* 64 bit block cipher
		* 5 modes of operation 
			* Electronic Codebook
			* Cipher block chaining
			* Cipher feedback
			* output feedback
			* counter 
		* key used is 56 bits 
		* uses XOR operations to generate cipher text 
		* 16 rounds of encryption 
	* 3DES
		* do DES 3 times with different keys 
			* 168 bit keys 
		* encryypt, decrypt, reencrypt
		* use two keys 
		* uses two keys but uses decrypton operation in the middle 
	* RC4 - Rivest Cipher 4
		* foundation of WEP and WPA encryption 
		* no longer good 
	* Blowfish/Twofish
		* alternative to DES and IDEA
		* uses 64 bit blocks of text 
		* varaible key bit length from 32 to 448 
		* blowfish 128 bit encryption key 
		* twofish - 128 bit blocks of data or keys of 256 bits in length 
			* almost as good as AES
		*
