5.7 Compare and contrast carious types of controls 

* Control - anything used to inplement security 
	* necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of objects 
* access control - a broad range of controls that preform such tasks as ensuring that only authorized users can log on 
# Deterrent 
* Deterrent - access control deployed to discoruage violation of security policies 
	* often dependent on individuals deciding not to take an unwanted action 
* ex.
	* policies, security awareness training, locks, fences, security badges, guards, mantraps, and security camera 
* directive access control is deployed to direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourage complaince with policies
* ex.
	* security policy requirements or criteria, posted notifications, escape route exit signs, monitoring, supervision, and procedures 
# Preventive 
* deployed to thwart or stop unwanted or unauthorized activiey from occuring 
* ex.
	* fences, locks, biometrics, mantraps, lighting, alarm system, separation of duties, job rotation, data classification, pen testing, access control methods, encryption, auditing, presence of security cams, smartcards, callback procedures, security policies, security awareness training, antivirus software, firewall, and IPSs
# Detective 
* deployed to disconver or detect unwanted or unauthorized activity 
* operate after the fact and can discover the activity only after it happens 
* ex. 
	* security guards, motion etection, recording, job rotation, mandatory vacations, audit trails, honeypots, IDSs, violation reports, supervision of users, incident investigations 
# Corrective 
* modifies the env to return systems to normal after an unwanted or unauthorized activity has happened
* attempts to correct any problems that occured as a result of a security incident 
* includes antivirus software 
* active IDS/IPS to modify the enc to stop an attack in progress 
* recovery controls 
	* an extension of corrective control but have more advanced or complex abilities 
	* ex. 
		* backups and restores, fault-tolerable drive systems, system imagineing, server clustering, antivirus software, and databse shadowing 
# Compensating 
* deployed to provide various options to other existing control to aid in enforcement and support of security polieies
* ex.
	* backups and alternate processing facilities
# Technical
* can be implemented administratively, logically/technically, or physically 
* involves hardware or software mechanisms used to manage access and provide protection for resources and systems 
* ex.
	* auth methods, encryption, constrained interfaces, access control lists, protocols, firewalls, routers, IDSs, and clipping levels 
# Administrative 
* policies and procedures defined by an orgs security policy and other reguation or requirments 
* sometimes called management controls 
* ex.
	* policies, procedures, hiring practives, background checks, data classification, security awerness, vacation history, reports and reviews, work supervision, personnel controls, and testing 
# Physical 
* items you can physically touch
* depoyed to prevent, monitor, or detect contact with systems or areas within a facility 
* ex.
	* guards, fences, motion dectors, locked doors, sealed windows, lights, cable protection, laptop locks, badges, swipe cards, guard dogs, video cameras, mantraps, and alarms
