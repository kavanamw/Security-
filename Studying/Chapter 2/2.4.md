* detect and filter all manner of malicuous wasteful, or otherwise unwanted traffic 
* does firewall, IDS, IPS, NATing, DoS protection, spam filtering, virus scanning, privacy protection, web filtering, spyware blocking, and activity tracking 
# Network Address Allocation
* subnetting - a divisioning process used on networks to divide larger groups of hosts into smaller collections 
	* mainly a logical acticity, but it can be used to direct or guide physical divisioning 
* subnet mask - a 32 bit binary number that indicates which portions of a host IP address, define the network ID, and which portion defines the host ID
* a host within a subnet is able to communicate directly with any other host in that same subnet 
* to connect one subnet to another first go to a default gateway, it sends it to the correct subnet 
* subbnetting uses - control communications, block access, divide security zones, and more
