2.6 Given a scenario, implement secure protocols 

# protocols 
* TCP/IP - primary protocol suit in use on the internet 
* IPv4 - 32 bit addresing system 
	* most of the public network 
	* Leyer 3
* IPv6 - uses 128 bit addressing system
	* eliminates broadcasting and fragmentation
	* includes native encryption 
# DNSSEC
* DNS - naming scheme used in both public and private networks 
* at first managed by the HOST file but dynamic DNS replaced it 
# S/MIME
* Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension - encryption for mail with RSA and AES
# SRTP
* Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol - improvment for RTP
	* used in VoIP
# LDAPS
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol - a directory service 
	* follows the x.500 standard 
	* LDAP has authentication built in 
	* tree structure 
# Secure POP/IMAP
* Post Office Protocol (POP)/Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - secured by TLS encryption 
	* email security
