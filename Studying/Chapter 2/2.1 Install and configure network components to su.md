2.1 Install and configure network components to support org security 

# Firewall
* Firewall - a software or hardware component designed to protect one network from another 
* deployed between areas of high and low trust
	* private and public network
	* between two networks that belong to the same org but used by different departments 
* manage traffic using filters (set of rules)
	* also known as ACL or tuples 
	* allow, deny, or log 
* first-match - the first rule that applies to the packet is followed, no other rules considered
	* place rules in priority order
	* most specific rules first followed by more general until universal 
	* IPtables apply and log all rules 
* implicit deny - if no rule applies, deny 
* packet filter - filters traffic based on id items found in a network packet's header. packet filtering firewalls operates on Layer 3 and Layer 4
* circut-level gateway - firewall type that filters traffic by filtering on the connection between an internal trusted host and an external untrusted host, Layer 3 or 5
* application-level gateway - firewall filters traffic based on user access, group membership, the app used, or type of resources being transmitted, Layer 7
* stateful inspection firewall - aware that any valid out-bound communication will trigger a corresponding response or reply from external entity 
* creates rules on the fly
* rules exist as long as the conversation is taking place 
* static packet filter - requires both an out-bound rule and an inbound rule be defined at all times 
* retains packets knowlegde of previous packets in a conversation in order to detect unwanted traffic not seen in individual packets 
	* known as context-anaylsis
	* may also do deep packet inspection 
	* better decision making 
* DMZ (Demilitarized zone) - hosts publically accessible servers 
* firewall provides secured but public access to the DMZ, but prevents unauthorized access to the private network 
* Ingress filter - traffic fulter on packets comming into a secured area from outside 
* Egress filter - traffic filter on packets leaving a secured area toward the outside
* ACL (Access Control List) - the rules or filters on a firewall can be refered to as an ACL 
# Application-based vs network-based
* application specific server-side firewall to prevent app specific payloads 
	* web app firewal - prevent web attacks 
	* network firewall - hardware device designed for general network filtering 
	* use both
# Stateful vs Stateless
* stateless firewall - anaylzes packs on an individual basis against filter ACLs
* stateful firewall - monitors the state or sesson of the communication, evals previous packts, context of communication 
# VPN Concentrator
* dedicated hardware device designed to support a large number of simultaneous VPN connections 
	* also called a VPN Server, VPN gateway, or VPN firewall
# Remote vs site-to-site
* remote VPN is a variant of site-to-site VPN
* remote access VPN one endpoint is the single entity of a remote user that connects into an orgs network 
* both known as tunneled mode VPNs
# IPSec
	* Internet Protocol Security 
	* VPN protocol for IPv4 derived from IPv6
	* uses AH (Authenticatoin Header) and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) protocols 
* provides symmetric encryption
	* uses IKE (Internet Key Exhcnage)
* ISAKMP (Internet Security Associateion and Key Management Protocol) to manage keys 
	* auth of comm peers
	* threat mitigation
	* security association creation and management 
	* cryptographic key establishment and mangagment 
# Tunnel mode 
* IPSec can do two modes, tunnel and transport 
	* tunnel 
		* provides encryption protection for both the payload and message header by encrypting entire packet and adding it's own temp IPSec header
	* transport 
		* provides encrpyion protection for just the payload and leaves the message header inteact, use on an untrusted network 
* AH - Provides assurances of message integrity and nonrepudation, auth and access control 
* ESP - provides confidentiality and integrity of packet contents, limited auth
% Split tunnel vs full tunnel
* split - VPN config that allows VPN to access both the org network over the VPN and the internet directly 
* full - all traffic through VPN then to the internet if needed 
# TLS 
* Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
	* uses port 443 for encryption comm session 
	* uses digital certs to RSA encryption/decryption 
	* uses both symmetric and asymmetric crypto
		* public and private key 
	* TLS - newer standard 
		* has replaced SSL due ot exploitable flaws in SSL
$ Always-on VPN
* one that attempts to auto-connect to the VPN service every network link 
	* good for public network and bad users 
# NIPS/NIDS
* IDS - Intrusion Detection system
	* designed to detect the presence of unauth untruder or bad activity 
	* passive monitor, detect not eliminate 
* IPS - Intrusion Prevention System 
	* detect attempts to gain unauth acces and to stop it 
	* more active 
* complimentary to firewalls 
* ![6ee978734bb30a418a77354b1367ffd1.png](../../../_resources/bcf13840149a4cf79c96c7ef4d45b03a.png)
* two types network and host (HIDP, HIPS)
* false postives are a problem 
* padded cell - a containment area that is activeted only when an intrusion is detected 
* ex of HIDS - antivirus software, anti-spyware, anomaly detectors
* IDS, not good for spoofed emails
# Signature-based 
* compares event patterns against known attack patterns stored in the IDS/IPS database
	* quickly and accuraetly detect any event from its database of signatures 
	* can't see new or unknown stuff
# Heuristic/behavioral 
* detection methods relies on the establishment of a baseline or a definition of normal and benign, anonmly detection
	* strength, detect any activites that vary from that is normal 
	* good for zero day attacks 
	* hard to say what is normal 
	* run suspicious program in a sansbox, if it looks like malicious code then it is 
	* Static anaylsis - decompile malicous program and look for known malicious subroutines
# Anomaly 
* watches for weird activity 
* commonly used for protocols 
# Inline vs Passive 
* inline IPS
	* 2 interfaces that all traffic must traverse through 
	* enables stopping and blocking 
* passive IDS
	* uses promiscuous mode NIC to eavesdrop on network comm
	* often a SPAN (Switch Port Anaylzer) port on a switch, gets a copy of every comm
	* also called IDS port, mirror port
# In-band vs out-of-band 
* in-band IDS - configured to monitor and filter both the pre-connect activites and the post-connect activites of each session 
	* pre - auth
	* post - traffic monitoring, content filtering, id based AC, ongoing verification
* out-of-band IDS - performs pre-connect acitivity monitoring, but then not be involved with any post-connect activit monitoring  
# Switch 
* Switch - a networking device used to connect many other devices together and potentially implement traffic mangament on their communication 
	* use MAC addresses to recieve signals in one port and transmit them out the port where the intended recipient is connected 
	* CAM (Contend Addressable Memory)
* good defense against sniffing attacks from random clients withing a network
	* only sniff traffic on the segment it's connected to 
# Port Security 
* Port Security - physical control of all connection ports, mangement of TCP and UDP ports
* port knocking - all ports on a system appear closed 
	* if the client sends packets to a specific set of ports in a certain order, then it's open
* 802.1X - not allowing network access without authenticating 
* Switch - Layer 2
* Switch cross-VLAN - Layer 3
# Loop Prevention 
* looping network wastes resources * can happen at layer 2 or 3
* Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) - resolves looping 
	* makes smart decisions based on the shape of the network 
* IP controls looping by controlling the distance a packet travles before it's discarded 
	* minimize the amount of looping before packets are terminated 
	* countdown timer in the IP header, the TTL value 
# Flood Guard
* flood guard - a defense against flooding or massive-traffic DoS attacks 
	* detet an attack then automatically block it 
	* overload the CAM table, once full of false addreses switch breaks 
# Proxy
* proxy server - a variation of an app firewall or circut level firewall
* use as a midleman between clients and servers 
* uses NAT to prevent leaking internal IPs
	* Forward Proxy 
		* standard proxy that acts as a intermediary or middleman for queries of external resources 
	* Reverse Proxy 
		* handles inbound requests from external systems to internally located services 
	* Transparent 
		* client not configured to send info to the proxy but it routes through it anyway 
		* uses for traffic filter 
# SSID 
* name of wireless network 
	* if several WAPs are involved in the same wireless network, an ESSID is defined 
* SSID is broadcast by the WAP via beacon frames 
# Fat vs. Thin
* Fat
	* AP that is fully managed wireless system, operates as a stand-alone wireless solution 
* Thin
	* little more than a wireless transmitter/reciever managed from a serarate external centeralized management console 
	* only handles radio signals 
	* more flexable for entireprise use 
# SIEM (Seucrity Information and Event Management)
* send alerts aor initiate alarms when specific values or levels are breached 
* can be more advanced than a SNMP (Simeple Network Management Console)
* used to monitor cluster of email servers 
	* monitors logs for events of intrest

* can also serve as a NAC solution
* asset tracking, MAC monitoring, IP management 
* Aggregation 
	* aggregation of logs, event fetails, and system measurements pulled from the range of devices throughout the network
* correlation 
	* the comparison and anaylsis of logged events in order to find similarties or repeating occurences 
* automated alterting and triggers
	* keeps network admins informed 
* Time sync 
	* analyzing events 
* event deduplication 
	* merging exact duplicates of the same event 
* Logs/WORM
	* create backup logs 
	* store logs on a WORM (Write-Once Read Many)
# DLP
	* Data Loss Prevention 
	* deep packet inspection, unauthorized access to senstive info
	* hardware and software 
* USB blocking 
	* block data exfiltration via USB or media SD cards 
* Cloud based 
	* strict authorization 
	* include both storage encryion and transport encryption 
* Email
	* blocking or filtering of attachments as well as limiting the use of HTML/web features for code transmission
# NAC 
	* prevent 0 day attacks
	* automated defense and response system 
	* pre-admission 
		* a system must meet all current security requiements before it's allowed to communicate with the network 
	* post-admission 
		* allow/deny decisions are made based on user activity 
# Mail Gateway 
* an add on security filter used to reduce the risk of malicious and wasteful emails 
* filters malware, phising, and spam before being delivered 
# Bridge 
* traditionally a device to link local LANs together 
	* replaced by switches 
* bridging or IP forwarding allws traffic to flow directly between the two connected interfaces without filters 
# Media Gateway 
* any device or service that convers data from one communication format to another 
* located at the intersection of two different types of networks 
* commonly used with VoIP systems 
# Hardware Security Module 
* cryptoprocessor used to manage and store digital encryption keys, accelerate crypto operations, support faster digital signatures, and improve authentication 
* add-on adapter or peripheral
* inclde tamper protection 
* secure valut for key storage 
* TPM 
	* special chip on portable motherboards can be used to store master encryption keys ued for whole drive encryion
# Passive vs. active 
* passive tool - technology that monitors a situation but doesn't do anything about it 
	* don't affect an event and are unseen by the event 
* active tool - one that intercedes in a situation in order to alter events or chance outcomes
	* alter settings, opening or closing ports, rebooting devices, launchings apps, disonnecting clients, restoring data,...
	* affect the event and thus detectable by the event
