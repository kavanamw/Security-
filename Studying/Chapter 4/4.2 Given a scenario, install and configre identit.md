4.2 Given a scenario, install and configre identity and access services 

# LDAP
* usually present by defualt in every private network 
* used in AD
* does include some authorization restriction
# Kerberos 
* used to authenticate people to other entities on the network 
* centrealized authenticatoin solution 
* KDC - key distribution center 
	* verifies identity of pricipals and granting access within a network 
* Single Sign-On solution 
* Ticket based sign on 
* mutual authentication - client and server ids are proven to eachother 
# TACACS+
* Terminal Access Controller Access Control System
* another AAA server 
* Similar to RADIUS
* uses TCP 49 and UDP 49 
* Cisco product 
# CHAP
* Challenge Handshake Authenticatoin Protocol
* used over a wide range of Point-to-Point protocol connection 
* provides secure transport of login creds 
* replaced PAP
# PAP
* Password Authentication Protocol
* insecure plain-tesxt password login mechanism 
# MSCHAP
* microsoft's customized propertary version of CHAP 
* support for mutual authentication rather than client only authentication 
* used DES encryption so is bad now 
# RADIUS
* Remote Authentication Dial-In Service 
* centeralized authenticaion system 
* often to provide an additonal layer of security for a network 
* a AAA server 
* good for VPN connections ]
* RADIUS Server - the centeralized authentication server 
* RADIUS Client - the client connecting to the RADIUS Server, a remote access client 
# SAML 
* Security Assertion Markup Langauge 
* open standard data format based on XML to support the exchange of authentication and authorization details between systems, service, and deivces 
* used to create federation authentication 
# OpenID Connect 
* internet based signle sign on solution 
* operatioes over OAuth protocol
* simplify the process by which apps are able to id and verify users 
# OAuth
* open standard for authentication and access delegation (federation)
* used by websites, web services, and mobile device apps 
* often impliented using SAML
* uses access tokens 
# Shibboleth
* another example of authenticaion federation and single sign-on solution
* based on SAML
# Secure Token
* a protected, possibly encryption authentication data set that proves a particular user or system has been verified through formal logon procedure
* access tokens, web cookies, kerberos tickets, and digital certs
# NTLM
* New Technology LAN Manager 
* a password hash storage system used on windows 
* NTLMv1 - a challenge-response protocol system 
* NTLMv2 - a challenge-response protocol system
	* more complex MD5 process 
* both vuln to password cracking 
* max password length of 14 characters 
* uses DES encryption 
# Access control models 
* Access Control - the mechanism by which users are granted or denied the ability to interact with and use resources 
* Three types 
# MAC - Mandatory Access Control
* AC commonly employed by goverment and militarty enviroments 
* access is granted based on a set of rules rather than at the discretion of the user 
* often called sensitivity labels, security domains, or classification 
* goverment 
	* unclassified
	* sensitive but unclassified
	* confidential
	* secret
	* top secret 
* public
	* public
	* sensitive
	* private
	* confidential/proprietary 
# DAC - Discretionary Access Control
* most often used, most common in home enviroments 
* user-directed, controlled by the owner and creater of the object 
* ACL used to attach every object and resource in an enviroment 
	* if not on the ACL then deny by default 
# ABAC - Attribute-based Access Control
* access through a scheme of attributes or characteristics 
* related to the user, object, system, app, network, service, time of day, or other 
# RBAC
* similar to MAC 
* rules like job descriptions, user groups, 
# Rule-based access control
* typically used in relation to network devices that filter traffic based on filtering rules 
* enfources rules independent of the user or the resources 
# Physical Access Control
* manage physical access 
* proxmitiy cards 
	* used to control physical access 
	* passive device, field powered device or transponder
